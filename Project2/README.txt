ECE455 Project 2 README
Bradley Pospeck
1) Multiple scripts were used, but "main.m" is my top-level script. 
Other scripts are jacobian.m, DLS.m, readInput.m and forKinematics.m

2) The most difficult part for me was getting started and figuring out
what direction to take my code. It's the first time I've really put
everything together that we've learned. That's generally always a slower
process for me.

3) Future students, and the person setting up the project, may disagree...
But it may be interesting to give students multiple different paths to work
through that help highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the 
different methods of performing inverse kinematics.
