CSU ECE455 - Introduction to Robot Programming and Simulation had 2 main programming projects.

Each folder of the projects contains the project descriptions as well as the code I was provided, the code I wrote
and the files needed for testing and running the code. I will provide a brief description of each project here:

1) We were given key frames and positions for a robot and needed to interpolate the points between those key frames for a specified number of frames to create enough points for a relatively smooth animation

2) We needed to generate the joint angles required to move a planar, n-link robot so the robot's hand follows a specified trajectory. This required calculating jacobians and performing forward and inverse kinematics.

Both projects were done in Matlab and required generalized solutions so it could handle different amounts of frames and robot joints.
